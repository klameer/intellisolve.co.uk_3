Understand business.

## Automate Processes
Is an opportunity to make your processes more efficient. Automation can save time and improve the quality of tasks. As you can code your computer to complete repetitive tasks.

### VBA Automation
A VBA macro is a piece of computer code that you write in Excel that gives it instructions to do certain tasks. This is immensely useful because you can get Excel to automate tasks. Excel can do these tasks better, faster and more accurately. 

Another cool thing about this is, using VBA, you can get MS Office applications to talk to each other and build solutions on top of the entire MS Office suite of programs. Hold you data in MS Access, do analysis and reporting on that data in MS Excel and present your findings in MS PowerPoint seamlessly. It's amazing how far you can go with this. 

VBA also allows you to write your own Excel functions. There are 500+ functions in Excel. If these are not enough, you can write your own. 

## Python Automation
This is where things get more interesting. You can go beyond Excel with Python. 

Pattern matching. Read a large body of text very quickly and extract out the information you need with powerful language processing tools. 
Read and write files or summarise data that is all over the place in different file formats in different directories.
Automatically visit as many web pages as you want and parse them for information. 
Schedule tasks that can be performed when you want them and be notified even on your phone when something happens. 

## Build Models
Statistical Modelling. Provides a basis for proving beyond reasonable doubt that there are patterns in your data. 

Financial Modelling. Financial modelling is the task of building an abstract representation (a model) of a real world financial situation. This is a mathematical model designed to represent (a simplified version of) the performance of a financial asset or portfolio of a business, project, or any other investment.

Data Modelling. When modelling complex processes, it helps to have an abstract simplified view of the data. It gives you a better understanding of the components in the process and allow you to make more informed decisions based on a better understanding of the data. A good data model is structured around its usefulness to the business and how it contributes to achieving business objectives.

## Analyse Data
Financial Data Analysis. Financial Data Analysis is the process of carrying out data analysis on financial data. A financial data analysis project has the same features of a data analysis project in that each of the stages are carried out to achieve a specific goal.
Custom Dashboards. 
Business Case Development.

## Data Migration
Data migration done the right way will bear fruit in the future. We have a methodology that we follow. 
A well managed data migration will ensure only the required information will be moved across to the new system or process. Validation and ownership must be put in place where the business owners sign off on the data when taking it over. A stakeholder must take on responsibility of the data. Because of this, communication is a key element of a successful data migration project.

## Golden Sources
A single version of the truth is a business intelligence term which means reducing ambiguity about an organisations data by storing it in one place. A common problem in organisations is that silos of the same data start to emerge in different areas of the organisation which invariably start to contradict each other. Making sure all users of the same data draw from the same source is essential for users to have confidence in the data and minimize errors in reporting. Intellisolve has a standard methodology in creating these Golden Sources on data.
