# Services

With business knowledge and experience. We can quickly understand your requirement and deliver the best solution using the right tools available to you. We specialise in small Excel, VBA and Python solutions within your finance department. A lot of these solutions can be helpful in other areas of business as well. 

## Automate Processes
Automating processes is an opportunity to make your organisation more efficient. Automating utilises the computing power you already have more effectively. Automation can do mundane tasks faster, more efficiently and at a higher quality leaving you to do the more important "thinking" tasks in your organisation. 

### VBA Automation
Excel is in the finance department of most organisations. A VBA macro is computer code that you write in Excel that gives it instructions to do tasks. This could be as simple as opening, reading and closing a file to things more complex like reading hundreds of stock prices from the internet and updating prediction models. These individual tasks can be grouped together and can be run at the right time either by you or when some other event happens. 

Another cool thing about VBA is that you can get MS Office applications to talk to each other and build solutions on top of the entire MS Office suite of programs. Hold your data in MS Access, do analysis and reporting on that data in MS Excel and present your findings in MS PowerPoint seamlessly. It's amazing how far you can go with this. 

VBA also allows you to write your own Excel functions. There are 500+ functions in Excel. If these are not enough, you can write your own. 

## Python Automation
Python is a general purpose programming language that has many applications from processing data to making your own games. Python automation goes beyond spreadsheets as it acts like the glue that brings together different solutions and lets them talk to each other. 
Here are some of the things we have done with Python:
 - Pattern matching with language processing tools. Read a large body of text very quickly and extract out the information you need. You can even figure out the mood of the sentence and if it is positive or negative. 
 - Read and write files or summarise data that is all over the place in different file formats in different directories.
 - Automatically visit as many web pages as you want and parse them for information. 
 - Schedule tasks that can be performed when you want them and be notified even on your phone when something happens. 

## Build Models
A model is an abstraction of a real world thing. It tries to focus only on the things that are important for the task at hand. For instance a basic financial model will look at the profit of a business undertaking and how this will be affected by changes in the amount of revenue. As the model gets more sophisticated, you will be able to project what the business may look like years into the future. As a model is not reality it will be wrong. But it may also be useful. 

Statistical Modelling tries to prove that there are links between elements of your model. Once you have this proof, you can take advantage of these links. This takes the guesswork out of knowing that a type of medication works or that the weather affects the sales of ice cream. 

Financial Modelling is an abstraction of a real work financial undertaking. It answers things like, should the business invest in a new showroom or is this stock right for my portfolio. Properly done you can ask the financial model questions like "how much do sales have to be for this product to be profitable" or "what is the maximum amount of interest I need to pay in order to find an investment". Business cases are types of financial models. A well constructed financial model will allow you to easily answer these questions in the way you want. 

Data Modelling includes financial modelling and statistical modelling and does modelling activities that don't easily fall under these categories. Although in business you would only undertake an activity if it makes financial sense. A good data model is structured around its usefulness to the business and how it contributes to achieving business objectives so this always has to be the core part or all models no matter what they are. 

## Analyse Data
Find patterns in your data and report on it can be a single activity or an ongoing one. Either way we can help with the most used tools that have stood the test of time. Although Excel has all the functionality to build fairly complex models, Python has world class statistical and machine learning libraries and patterns to solve almost any analysis problem you can throw at it. It is a viable solution if you start pushing against the [limitations of Excel](http://findingpatterns.co.uk/pandas-vs-excel-who-will-win.html). 

## Data Migration
Data migration is moving data between applications. It means taking the data in the format that you currently have in your source system and changing it into a format that is useful in your target system.

Data migration done the right way will bear fruit in the future. We have a methodology that we follow that has worked in the past to produce satisfied customers.

## Advisory
If your project is technical in nature, it will pay dividends if you enlist a specialist at the beginning to advise on the best way to build a solution. The further along the project you are, the more expensive mistakes become. We know a few things really well Excel, VBA and some problems Python solves. Get us involved and be confident that your course of action is more right.

# Tools we use

We specialise. Tools are only as good as how you use them. Having used the same tools for many years and in such different scenarios we can leverage these skills to help you solve your some of your business problems in the best way possible. 

## Microsoft Excel
The language of finance is written in Excel and even though there are alternatives out there, if your finance department has a computer, chances are that they will have a version of Excel running on it. The popularity of Excel is due to its flexibility. A spreadsheet can be many things. A report, a data set, a model and even a prediction of the future. 

## VBA
VBA allows you to enhance Excel and other MS Office programs by allowing you to write code to enhance their functionality. This includes doing things like automating repetitive functions and create custom solutions with a rich set of tools provided by Microsoft. 

## MS Access
Probably the most underused application in the MS Office suite. MS Access is a desktop relational database. This means you can have a lot of the functionality of a RDMS like organising and querying large amounts of data. It provides great functionality for small to medium sized businesses to build solutions on. 

## Python
A general purpose programming language that has many applications in the business world. Python has useful and mature libraries for solving problems like data processing, statistics, data visualisation and even building web applications. Python can even help you run prediction algorithms on your data and has visualisation tools to deep dive into your data. 

## Project Management
Although this is not a product, proper project management means understanding your requirement as early and as accurately as possible to deliver the best solution for your requirement. We have a proven methodology that has worked in the past that deals with all the steps to increase the likelihood of successful delivery.

# Case Studies
## Modelling Global Data Storage
A well organised financial model shines a light onto the the variables in the enterprise that matter as well as the relationships between components of the model. Users should be be able to easily see how changes in one variable influences changes in another variable. Although all financial models are different, there are best practices that can be applied that can make the models easier to use and more insightful.
