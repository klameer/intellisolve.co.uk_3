## Automate Processes
Is an opportunity to make your processes more efficient. Automation can save time and improve the quality of tasks. As you can code your computer to complete repetitive tasks.

### VBA Automation
A VBA macro is a piece of computer code that you write in Excel that gives it instructions to do certain tasks. This is immensely useful because you can get Excel to automate tasks. Excel can do these tasks better, faster and more accurately. 

Another cool thing about this is, using VBA, you can get MS Office applications to talk to each other and build solutions on top of the entire MS Office suite of programs. Hold you data in MS Access, do analysis and reporting on that data in MS Excel and present your findings in MS PowerPoint seamlessly. It's amazing how far you can go with this. 

VBA also allows you to write your own Excel functions. There are 500+ functions in Excel. If these are not enough, you can write your own. 

## Python Automation
This is where things get more interesting. You can go beyond Excel with Python. 

Pattern matching. Read a large body of text very quickly and extract out the information you need with powerful language processing tools. 
Read and write files or summarise data that is all over the place in different file formats in different directories.
Automatically visit as many web pages as you want and parse them for information. 
Schedule tasks that can be performed when you want them and be notified even on your phone when something happens.
