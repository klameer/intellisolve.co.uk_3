# What we do

## Data Insight

Data insight is the process of extracting useful information from data. Useful in a business setting is information that will help your organisation achieve their goals. The objectives of insight projects should align with the business objectives. Although an insight project is a one off process, the outcomes will eventually be taken over by the business as it adapts to the new information.

Well organised data insight projects follow a methodology that builds its self around business objectives. The main stages in the project documented here.

Intellisolve has a tried and tested methodology used to deliver tangible results and deals with:

Helping frame the objectives of the of the project.
Enlisting subject matter experts on specialist knowledge within industries.
Creating models.
Interpreting and communicating results.
Building reporting pipelines to track future activity.
Overall project management.

## Management Reports
Financial and Management Reporting give you feedback on how well your business is achieving its objectives.

Financial Reporting
Financial reporting is a standard set of reports that all businesses need to produce to communicate with external stakeholders. It is a legal requirement that they are created in a particular format.

They consist of the Profit and Loss Account, Balance Sheet and Statement of Cashflows. They are externally focused and present a standard way of determining the health of the company. Financial Reporting is historically focused. Because they are in a standard format, they allow you to compare businesses and are the main documents used to convey the wellbeing of the business.

Management Reporting
Management Reporting is mainly used for the stakeholders running the business. They are a bespoke internally focused set of reports carefully considered to track to the objectives of the company.

Examples of management reporting are costing production of goods or getting a breakdown of staff by department.

Management reporting falls within a larger data analytics project and is involved in suggesting and gathering the most important metrics that an organisation needs to focus on in order to reach its business goals.

Intellisolve has worked on world class Management Accounting projects in a wide range of business settings, utilising the latest research on what is currently hot and working in the industry.

## Custom Dashboards
A dashboard is a tool that helps organisations track how they are performing against a given objective. It provides information about Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and metrics. Dashboards often make use of data visualizations as a means of making sense of complex data sets. They help to summarize a situation and helps users quickly draw conclusions on what the data is trying to tell them.

There are 2 popular approaches to creating dashboards. Each delivering a similar outcome to the same problem domain of delivering information from data.

Excel Dashboards
Due to Excels inherent flexibility, it has become one of the most widely used tools for creating dashboards for decades now. Although Excel has come a long way since the days of Lotus 123, its fundamental design philosophy has not changed. Excel's popularity means that users like what it does, providing a high quality platform for data storage, analysis and reporting.

Web Dashboards
Web dashboards take you beyond a file based reporting and address the shortcomings of reporting to multiple users. In addition to this, the solutions are elegant and robust and the quality of output is improved. There is a blog post on how to get up and running with a web dashboard and touches on some of the some of the reasons why you would adopt this approach to reporting.

Intellisolve has worked on a wide range of dashboarding projects, utilizing the latest technology and research on the best way to deliver information.

Dashboarding falls within a larger data analytics project and is involved in delivering information to the business in a way that is both timely and useful.

## Data Modelling
We can help you gain a better understanding of your processes and systems by organizing and summarizing the data available in your organisation. Viewing your data differently can give you a different perspective and thereby more insight into your business.
A well thought out data model gives you a understanding of your business and processes and helps you plan.

The main ways data can be modelled are:

Creating conceptual models of data to identify relationships at the highest level.
Modelling relationships between data sets in an enterprise.
Logical data modelling which models entities and the relationships between them.
Physical data models which are based on the logical data models.

## Financial Modelling

Financial modeling is the task of building an abstract representation (a model) of a real world financial situation. This is a mathematical model designed to represent (a simplified version of) the performance of a financial asset or portfolio of a business, project, or any other investment.

## Process Automation

Automating processes is an opportunity of making your organisation more efficient. Automation can save time and improve accuracy and allows you to take on more than you normally would have during a manual process. We have the technical expertise and experience automating data processes and reporting using popular frameworks such as Excel VBA and the Python programming language.

## Advisory

Getting data analysts involved in complex programs early in the process pays off in the future. As solutions become increasingly complex the cost of fixing problems later increases exponentially. Advice from an experienced data analyst who can understand your requirements can suggest organising data and process requirements around the program requirements giving you a higher likelihood of success. Intellisolve has acted in the capacity of adviser in large scale programs organizing and structuring data and processes early so program management has access to information when they need it.

## Data Migration

A well managed data migration will ensure only the required information will be moved across to the new system or process. Validation and ownership must be put in place where the business owners sign off on the data when taking it over. A stakeholder must take on responsibility of the data. Because of this, communication is a key element of a successful data migration project.

# Our Process
No two projects are alike but no two projects are entirely different. If you want to know what to expect when you engage with us have a look. It is designed to minimize any risk to you when getting your solution built.


You will own the solution in the end and a good solution is a useful one. Because of this, colloboration is key. You know your business, you know your industry, you know the problem to be solved. We will provide the technical know how. Understanding requirements are key to this process and we will constantly confirm that our understanding is correct using an agile way of building solutions. Our priority is to deliver excellence and to keep you coming back.


## Initial Enquiry
One of the most crucial parts of the process and the foundation for a successful project. We spend time getting a real understanding of your business need and how we can provide you the best solution.

## First Quotation

Based on the initial inquiry the quotation will outline the process of delivering the solution to you. It will include a rough estimation of the timeframe involved.


## Functional Specification

If you are happy with the initial quotation, we will create a detailed specification of what will be delivered. It could involve a visit to your organisation or meetings with the people benefitting from the solution. The functional specification will go in to as much detail as possible into not only what will be done but also what will not be done. It will ensure that all parties are on the same page about what is expected.

## Final Quotation
Once we have an exact understanding of what you need, the final quotation will be submitted. The final quotation will include details of time and cost. If we are working with any of your staff then the we will propose times for meetings. We will try and be as accommodating to your timings as possible.

## Project Development

The project will commence on the terms of the final quotation. We will try to stick to the timetable. Any changes will be discussed and approved. You will always be kept up to date on what is happening with the project.


## Testing
The quickest ways to iron out bugs in a solution is to have a comprehensive testing strategy that tests all elements of the solution both at a functional level but also the inner workings as well. All the items in the functional specification above will be tested and a complete test report will be presented to make sure you are aware of what was tested.


## Final Delivery
After everyone is happy with the tests, the project will go live. You will be using what was built in your business. In addition to the project, Intellisolve will provide useful documents like user manuals and documentation about the solutions so it could be taken over at a future date if needed.
