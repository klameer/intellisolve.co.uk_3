      <h2 id="financialdataanalysisathsbc">Financial Data Analysis at HSBC</h2>

      <p>A well organized financial model shines a spotlight on the elements of the enterprise that guarantee success and the relationship between the components of the model. Users should be able to see how making a change in one of the components affects the others. At intellisolve, we have a standard methodology of creating models that focuses on business goals first. We then use our expertise in Excel to make these items stand out so that the finance can see what they need to focus on.</p>

      <h3 id="thechallenge">The Challenge</h3>

      <p>Create a financial model that shows the state of global enterprise data storage. The model should give the ability to slice data by different dimensions such as line of business and type of hardware. The model should also summarize the current global view of storage and predict the future storage requirement based growth. The model should be able to run different scenarios to highlight what would happen in these alternate realities.</p>

      <h3 id="thesolution">The Solution</h3>

      <p>This was a two fold solution, first building a consolidated operational data model based on the HSBC global estate. The financial side  of the operational was presented separately. The model included a parameters section where all the variables were presented in one place along with the summary of the entire model. Here users could easily see the impact a change in one variable had in the rest of the model. This made it easy for users to consider alternative scenarios for enterprise storage in the short to long term.</p>

      <h3 id="theresult">The Result</h3>

      <p>Using Intellisolve's business centric methodology for creating financial models meant the end product was created using a framework that was guaranteed to deliver a useful solution.
      The final model clearly showed the relationships between the various components and gave executives overall visibility of the interactions between  components. The final product highlighted the areas where significant costs could be saved.</p>

      <h2 id="statisticalmodellingproject">Statistical Modelling Project</h2>

      <p>A statistical model takes the guesswork out of thinking there are patterns in your data. Using a statistical model, you can mathematically prove if there are relationships between elements of a dataset and if so you can assign a number to the degree of the relationship. When you model real world data, relationships are a grey area. There are exceptions to rules due to the complexity of real world interactions. Intellisolve sets up statistical models the same way as financial models, focusing on the business need first and building the model around that.</p>

      <h3 id="thechallenge-2">The Challenge</h3>

      <p>Take a list of 10,000+ stock price movements and group them into similar transactions. Once the transactions were grouped, run simulations to infer the best trading strategies for specific categories of transactions. Once the best trading strategies were figured out, run optimization algorithms to infer the best parameters for the trading strategies to minimize risk while optimizing profit. All this to be put into a standard reporting format for further analysis.</p>

      <h3 id="thesolution-2">The Solution</h3>

      <p>A proper statistical and data analysis solution implemented within an agile framework to give the most relevant solution in the least possible time. Intellisolve has a standard methodology of delivering analysis solutions that has worked well in the past. The share price movements were held in a master data set. The solution was organized in such a way that the parameters could be changed in order to run simulations and scenario analysis and eventually work out the best trading strategies for specific categories of transactions.</p>

      <h3 id="theresult-2">The Result</h3>

      <p>A complete end to end data analysis project from acquiring the data to processing to the final reporting in a way that was adaptable. Running strategies through parameters meant that when new strategies could be devised and evaluated quickly. Excellent web reporting meant that there was high quality reporting available for analysis with the option of going from a summary view to a drill down of data to a transaction level. Proper project organisation and documentation meant that this analysis could be taken over at a later date with minimum friction to the new users.</p>

      <h2 id="formsreportingatthenhs">Forms Reporting at the NHS</h2>

      <p>A forms application is a great solution for collecting data from multiple places and presenting reports to multiple users all from a web application. The application can be hosted either online or within your local network with great security in place making your data secure. Permissions on the application will ensure only the right people get access to the right information.</p>

      <h3 id="thechallenge-3">The Challenge</h3>

      <p>Replace a paper based data collection system with an online web application. In the existing system, paper based records were faxed to a central location for review and updated and gathered onto a master Excel spreadsheet. Due to the nature of the operation this process was error prone and users spent a lot of time validating data. Resources were spent on security due to the sensitive nature of the information such as locked rooms and secure lines of communication.</p>

      <h3 id="thesolution-3">The Solution</h3>

      <p>The solution was a web application where the data was collected securely at source. It could then be validated at the point of entry guaranteeing only the highest quality data was captured. All past data was migrated into the application giving a historical view to users. All migrated data was tagged in the database to add security so it could be presented only on a need to know basis. A standard set of reports were made available to all users including customized reports when they were required.</p>

      <h3 id="theresult-3">The Result</h3>

      <p>A seamless process to gather, validate and report on data. Users we more confident with the data due to the validation processes put in place. The new online system meant that all resources used to maintain the paper based records were freed up. The turnaround time for creating new reports was much faster because of the proper organisation and centralisation of data. Proper data analysis meant that more insightful reporting could be carried out to the benefit of NHS local authorities.</p>

      <h2 id="goldensourcesatdeutschebank">Golden Sources at Deutsche Bank</h2>

      <p>A single version of the truth is a business intelligence term which means reducing ambiguity about an organisations data by storing it in one place. A common problem in organisations is that silos of the same data start to emerge in different areas of the organisation which invariably start to contradict each other. Making sure all users of the same data draw from the same source is essential for users to have confidence in the data and minimize errors in reporting. Intellisolve has a standard methodology in creating these Golden Sources on data.</p>

      <h3 id="thechallenge-4">The Challenge</h3>

      <p>Create a Golden Source of data for employees within a major technology transformation project within Deutsche Bank. The transformation project had multiple work streams which affected different areas of the organisation structure. The golden source of employee data had to identify where the employees were on the organisation structure and what work streams affected them. This would be used for work stream baseline calculations to gauge the employees that fell under the scope of the workstream. The dataset had to be version controlled to reflect the changes made in the programme.</p>

      <h3 id="thesolution-4">The Solution</h3>

      <p>Create one golden source of employee data that included all the necessary information required for the programme work streams. This was a group project that required input from all the managers of the work streams including the major functions within the organisation. Documentation was available on how all the information was derived and the sources of the data. Any conflicts of data had to be documented and presented to the right stakeholders.  </p>

      <h3 id="theresult-4">The Result</h3>

      <p>The result was a data set that all stakeholders sanctioned and were confident with the data. This was in a format that could be easily shared and tagged with new information came up. Version controlling meant that any changes in the data set could be documented and shared. The employee dataset was an important feature in the overall program. Having a single version of the truth meant that program decisions could be taken with less overall friction.</p>

      <h2 id="datamigrationinskype">Data Migration in Skype</h2>

      <p>A well managed data migration will ensure only the required information will be moved across to the new system or process. Validation and ownership must be put in place where the business owners sign off on the data when taking it over. A stakeholder must take on responsibility of the data. Because of this, communication is a key element of a successful data migration project.</p>

      <h3 id="thechallenge-5">The Challenge</h3>

      <p>Extract Skype's general ledger held on eBay's ERP system. The data had to be complete, balanced and validated by stakeholders in both Skype and eBay for accuracy and completeness. The number of transactions far exceeded Excel's capacity of 65,000 rows at the time so Excel had to process text files that held the data.</p>

      <h3 id="thesolution-5">The Solution</h3>

      <p>Create macros on Excel to process comma separated (csv) files. The macros had to summarize these files in order to validation tests in place and for final signoff. This was then joined into a larger process of overall validation of the data which had to be handed over to the business owners.</p>

      <h3 id="theresult-5">The result</h3>

      <p>A well documented end to end process that showed the steps involved including business ownership and validation of data, provided confidence that all the relevant data had been extracted.</p>

      <h2 id="datamigrationatbaxi">Data Migration at Baxi</h2>

      <p>A well organised data migration project is similar to a data analysis project where it is documented well enough to be easily transferable and adaptable. If someone was picking it up in the future, they should be able to do so spending a minimum amount of time learning about the project and how it is structured. At Intellisolve, proper documentation is important. Each stage in the project is done with the necessary documentation as priority.</p>

      <h3 id="thechallenge-6">The Challenge</h3>

      <p>Migrate all historical data from SAP R3 to a new M3 ERP system for 4 main SAP modules. The complete data set had to be put into a format that could be easily uploaded to M3 ERP system in a standard format. For each module, data for closed and open items and header and detailed information had to be extracted and put into a standard format for upload.</p>

      <h3 id="thesolution-6">The Solution</h3>

      <p>The project structure included raw data to the final dataset in the format required to upload into M3. Each of the transformations to the data was properly documented so the customer could tell the story of how the final dataset was derived. There were multiple sets of data which included the complete data set created in a format that could be queried for historical reasons as well as well as the formatted data set for upload. <br />
      All the queries were documented showing the data sets as well as the meaning of each field.</p>

      <h3 id="theresult-6">The Result</h3>

      <p>The complete processed and analysed data was presented on time and on budget with the required data sets to upload into the target system as well as the ability to query historical data without the need to revert to the source system. This meant a significant cost saving on maintenance.</p>

      <h2 id="businesscaseanalysisatvodafone">Business Case Analysis at Vodafone</h2>

      <p>Before creating a business case, it is best to start out with the business objectives and what the plan is to measure these. Once the objectives are worked out, the business case can then be built around these. Intellisolve have a standard methodology of delivering business centric business cases, working out the customer objectives first so stakeholders will be focused on this throughout the process.</p>

      <h3 id="thechallenge-7">The Challenge</h3>

      <p>Vodafone was going through a major global infrastructure investment project. This involved multiple countries with multiple channels of investment which meant there was over a thousand business cases that needed to be appraised and the project required the ability to summarize these over different dimensions such as region, channel, country, etc.</p>

      <h3 id="thesolution-7">The Solution</h3>

      <p>The solution was to standardize all the business cases and create a reporting cube that could be easily sliced and diced and shared over the programme.</p>

      <h3 id="theresult-7">The Result</h3>

      <p>Creating a single version of the truth meant there was consistency over the whole programme. Communication over the programme related to one data source where the data was validated and everyone agreed with. Intellisolve has a standard methodology for creating these golden sources of data which provides a well agreed upon data set in the shortest possible time.</p>

      <h2 id="computerstorageallocationathsbc">Computer Storage Allocation at HSBC</h2>

      <p>Bringing together different silos of data in your organisation is frequently a great source of insight. It gives you the ability to see how processes fit into the bigger picture of your organisation and how these function together. The data could already be available to you or be created with minimal effort to provide a greater benefit.</p>

      <h3 id="thechallenge-8">The Challenge</h3>

      <p>HSBC wanted a view of how their data storage was utilized over the world. The source of the data came from a list of all their storage hardware and storage array logs. The view had to capture the country and regional summaries but also be able to drill down to an individual storage array level. All reporting had to be packaged in a way to allow storage executives to make strategic decisions on global storage.</p>

      <h3 id="thesolution-8">The Solution</h3>

      <p>Storage array logs generate a lot of data. When considered at a global level, it would normally break Excels one million line limit. As there was MS Office already installed on the development computer, the best fit solution was using MS Excel and MS Access.</p>

      <h4 id="loadingdata">Loading Data</h4>

      <p>The array operational logs would be saved to a location on the network and a VBA script would be run to import the data into an Access database. The old data would be summarized and archived for reporting and trend analysis. The new data would then be aggregated to make reporting queries more efficient and take less time to load.</p>

      <h4 id="reporting">Reporting</h4>

      <p>A host of reports were presented as dashboards on Excel. These reports connected to the summary tables on the access database and were refreshed when the reporting file was opened.</p>

      <h3 id="theresult-8">The Result</h3>

      <p>The streamlined solution enabled all the dashboards to be generated just by opening and refreshing a file. The global views as well as the ability to drill down to region, country, data center and individual array let management see patterns in how data was allocated. Due to the overall investment of the bank, any insight into this area proved to be a massive benefit as optimisation provided significant cost saving.</p>

      <h2 id="automatedatasetcreationatthenhs">Automate Data Set Creation at the NHS</h2>

      <p>Automating processes is an opportunity of making your organisation more efficient. Automation can save time and improve accuracy and allows you to take on more than you normally would have during a manual process. We have the technical expertise and experience automating data processes and reporting using popular frameworks such as Excel VBA and the Python programming language.</p>

      <h3 id="thechallenge-9">The Challenge</h3>

      <p>Automate a manual process which consolidated data from 3 different patient information systems. The final data set was according to national data set standards. The process would be automated from the extracting the data to creating the final data set.</p>

      <h3 id="thesolution-9">The Solution</h3>

      <p>An automated process was set in place using the Excel macros. Reporting within the process for summary information as well as trend analysis for local reporting.</p>

      <h4 id="extraction">Extraction</h4>

      <p>Data connections were created on Excel workbooks to run queries on the patient data systems. The queries were executed by running a VBA macro on the workbook.</p>

      <h4 id="processing">Processing</h4>

      <p>The extracted data was copied onto a worksheet and this was then consolidated. If there were no proper formulas available, then macro formulas were used.</p>

      <h3 id="theresult-9">The Result</h3>

      <ul>
      <li>The resulting solution shortened the process of creating the data set from 1 week to half a day.  The only delay being the time taken to update the patient systems with the latest data.</li>

      <li>Automation considerably improved the quality of the final dataset as it was less prone to human error.</li>

      <li>Reporting systems in place meant that management could see an overview of each dataset with checks in place to ensure data quality.</li>
      </ul>
