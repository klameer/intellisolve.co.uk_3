# Services

With business knowledge and experience. We can quickly understand your requirement and deliver the best solution using the right tools available to you. We specialise in small Excel, VBA and Python solutions within your finance department. A lot of these solutions can be helpful in other areas of business as well. 

## Automate Processes
Automating processes is an opportunity to make your organisation more efficient. Automating utilises the computing power you already have more effectively. Automation can do mundane tasks faster, more efficiently and at a higher quality leaving you to do the more important "thinking" tasks in your organisation. 

### VBA Automation
Excel is in the finance department of most organisations. A VBA macro is computer code that you write in Excel that gives it instructions to do tasks. This could be as simple as opening, reading and closing a file to things more complex like reading hundreds of stock prices from the internet and updating prediction models. These individual tasks can be grouped together and can be run at the right time either by you or when some other event happens. 

Another cool thing about VBA is that you can get MS Office applications to talk to each other and build solutions on top of the entire MS Office suite of programs. Hold your data in MS Access, do analysis and reporting on that data in MS Excel and present your findings in MS PowerPoint seamlessly. It's amazing how far you can go with this. 

VBA also allows you to write your own Excel functions. There are 500+ functions in Excel. If these are not enough, you can write your own. 

## Python Automation
Python is a general purpose programming language that has many applications from processing data to making your own games. Python automation goes beyond spreadsheets as it acts like the glue that brings together different solutions and lets them talk to each other. 
Here are some of the things we have done with Python:
 - Pattern matching with language processing tools. Read a large body of text very quickly and extract out the information you need. You can even figure out the mood of the sentence and if it is positive or negative. 
 - Read and write files or summarise data that is all over the place in different file formats in different directories.
 - Automatically visit as many web pages as you want and parse them for information. 
 - Schedule tasks that can be performed when you want them and be notified even on your phone when something happens. 

## Build Models
A model is an abstraction of a real world thing. It tries to focus only on the things that are important for the task at hand. For instance a basic financial model will look at the profit of a business undertaking and how this will be affected by changes in the amount of revenue. As the model gets more sophisticated, you will be able to project what the business may look like years into the future. As a model is not reality it will be wrong. But it may also be useful. 

Statistical Modelling tries to prove that there are links between elements of your model. Once you have this proof, you can take advantage of these links. This takes the guesswork out of knowing that a type of medication works or that the weather affects the sales of ice cream. 

Financial Modelling is an abstraction of a real work financial undertaking. It answers things like, should the business invest in a new showroom or is this stock right for my portfolio. Properly done you can ask the financial model questions like "how much do sales have to be for this product to be profitable" or "what is the maximum amount of interest I need to pay in order to find an investment". Business cases are types of financial models. A well constructed financial model will allow you to easily answer these questions in the way you want. 

Data Modelling includes financial modelling and statistical modelling and does modelling activities that don't easily fall under these categories. Although in business you would only undertake an activity if it makes financial sense. A good data model is structured around its usefulness to the business and how it contributes to achieving business objectives so this always has to be the core part or all models no matter what they are. 

## Analyse Data
Find patterns in your data and report on it can be a single activity or an ongoing one. Either way we can help with the most used tools that have stood the test of time. Although Excel has all the functionality to build fairly complex models, Python has world class statistical and machine learning libraries and patterns to solve almost any analysis problem you can throw at it. It is a viable solution if you start pushing against the [limitations of Excel](http://findingpatterns.co.uk/pandas-vs-excel-who-will-win.html). 

## Data Migration
Data migration is moving data between applications. It means taking the data in the format that you currently have in your source system and changing it into a format that is useful in your target system.

Data migration done the right way will bear fruit in the future. We have a methodology that we follow that has worked in the past to produce satisfied customers.

## Advisory
If your project is technical in nature, it will pay dividends if you enlist a specialist at the beginning to advise on the best way to build a solution. The further along the project you are, the more expensive mistakes become. We know a few things really well Excel, VBA and some problems Python solves. Get us involved and be confident that your course of action is more right.

# Tools we use

We specialise. Tools are only as good as how you use them. Having used the same tools for many years and in such different scenarios we can leverage these skills to help you solve your some of your business problems in the best way possible. 

## Microsoft Excel
The language of finance is written in Excel and even though there are alternatives out there, if your finance department has a computer, chances are that they will have a version of Excel running on it. The popularity of Excel is due to its flexibility. A spreadsheet can be many things. A report, a data set, a model and even a prediction of the future. 

## VBA
VBA allows you to enhance Excel and other MS Office programs by allowing you to write code to enhance their functionality. This includes doing things like automating repetitive functions and create custom solutions with a rich set of tools provided by Microsoft. 

## MS Access
Probably the most underused application in the MS Office suite. MS Access is a desktop relational database. This means you can have a lot of the functionality of a RDMS like organising and querying large amounts of data. It provides great functionality for small to medium sized businesses to build solutions on. 

## Python
A general purpose programming language that has many applications in the business world. Python has useful and mature libraries for solving problems like data processing, statistics, data visualisation and even building web applications. Python can even help you run prediction algorithms on your data and has visualisation tools to deep dive into your data. 

## Project Management
Although this is not a product, proper project management means understanding your requirement as early and as accurately as possible to deliver the best solution for your requirement. We have a proven methodology that has worked in the past that deals with all the steps to increase the likelihood of successful delivery.

# Case Studies
## Modelling Global Data Storage
A well organised financial model shines a light onto the the variables in the enterprise that matter as well as the relationships between components of the model. Users should be be able to easily see how changes in one variable influences changes in another variable. Although all financial models are different, there are best practices that can be applied that can make the models easier to use and more insightful. 

### The Challenge
Create a data/financial model that shows the state of enterprise data storage. The model should give the ability to slice data by different dimensions such as line of business and type of hardware. The model should also summarise the current global view of storage and predict the future storage requirement based growth. The model should be able to run different scenarios to highlight what would happen in these alternate realities.

### The Solution
This was a two fold solution, first building a consolidated operational data model based on the HSBC global estate. The financial side of the operational was presented separately. The model included a parameters section where all the variables were presented in one place along with the summary of the entire model. Here users could easily see the impact a change in one variable had in the rest of the model. This made it easy for users to consider alternative scenarios for enterprise storage in the short to long term.

### The Result
Using Intellisolve's business centric methodology for creating financial models meant the end product was created using a framework that was guaranteed to deliver a useful solution. The final model clearly showed the relationships between the various components and gave executives overall visibility of the interactions between components. The final product highlighted the areas where significant costs could be saved.

## Financial Modelling at Barclays
A well organized financial model shines a spotlight on the elements of the enterprise that guarantee success and the relationship between the components of the model. Users should be able to see how making a change in one of the components affects the others. At intellisolve, we have a standard methodology of creating models that focuses on business goals first. We then use our expertise in Excel to make these items stand out so that the finance can see what they need to focus on.

## Statistical Modelling Project at MF Global

A statistical model takes the guesswork out of thinking there are patterns in your data. Using a statistical model, you can mathematically prove if there are relationships between elements of a dataset and if so you can assign a number to the degree of the relationship. When you model real world data, relationships are a grey area. There are exceptions to rules due to the complexity of real world interactions. Intellisolve sets up statistical models the same way as financial models, focusing on the business need first and building the model around that.

### The Challenge

Take a list of 10,000+ stock price movements and group them into similar transactions. Once the transactions were grouped, run simulations to infer the best trading strategies for specific categories of transactions. Once the best trading strategies were figured out, run optimization algorithms to infer the best parameters for the trading strategies to minimize risk while optimizing profit. All this to be put into a standard reporting format for further analysis.

### The Solution

A proper statistical and data analysis solution implemented within an agile framework to give the most relevant solution in the least possible time. Intellisolve has a standard methodology of delivering analysis solutions that has worked well in the past. The share price movements were held in a master data set. The solution was organized in such a way that the parameters could be changed in order to run simulations and scenario analysis and eventually work out the best trading strategies for specific categories of transactions.

## Forms Reporting at the NHS

A forms application is a great solution for collecting data from multiple places and presenting reports to multiple users all from a web application. The application can be hosted either online or within your local network with great security in place making your data secure. Permissions on the application will ensure only the right people get access to the right information.

### The Challenge

Replace a paper based data collection system with an online web application. In the existing system, paper based records were faxed to a central location for review and updated and gathered onto a master Excel spreadsheet. Due to the nature of the operation this process was error prone and users spent a lot of time validating data. Resources were spent on security due to the sensitive nature of the information such as locked rooms and secure lines of communication.

### The Solution

The solution was a web application where the data was collected securely at source. It could then be validated at the point of entry guaranteeing only the highest quality data was captured. All past data was migrated into the application giving a historical view to users. All migrated data was tagged in the database to add security so it could be presented only on a need to know basis. A standard set of reports were made available to all users including customized reports when they were required.

### The Result

A seamless process to gather, validate and report on data. Users we more confident with the data due to the validation processes put in place. The new online system meant that all resources used to maintain the paper based records were freed up. The turnaround time for creating new reports was much faster because of the proper organisation and centralisation of data. Proper data analysis meant that more insightful reporting could be carried out to the benefit of NHS local authorities.

## Golden Sources at Deutsche Bank

A single version of the truth is a business intelligence term which means reducing ambiguity about an organisations data by storing it in one place. A common problem in organisations is that silos of the same data start to emerge in different areas of the organisation which invariably start to contradict each other. Making sure all users of the same data draw from the same source is essential for users to have confidence in the data and minimize errors in reporting. Intellisolve has a standard methodology in creating these Golden Sources on data.

### The Challenge

Create a Golden Source of data for employees within a major technology transformation project within Deutsche Bank. The transformation project had multiple work streams which affected different areas of the organisation structure. The golden source of employee data had to identify where the employees were on the organisation structure and what work streams affected them. This would be used for work stream baseline calculations to gauge the employees that fell under the scope of the workstream. The dataset had to be version controlled to reflect the changes made in the programme.

### The Solution

Create one golden source of employee data that included all the necessary information required for the programme work streams. This was a group project that required input from all the managers of the work streams including the major functions within the organisation. Documentation was available on how all the information was derived and the sources of the data. Any conflicts of data had to be documented and presented to the right stakeholders.

### The Result

The result was a data set that all stakeholders sanctioned and were confident with the data. This was in a format that could be easily shared and tagged with new information came up. Version controlling meant that any changes in the data set could be documented and shared. The employee dataset was an important feature in the overall program. Having a single version of the truth meant that program decisions could be taken with less overall friction.

## Data Migration in Skype

A well managed data migration will ensure only the required information will be moved across to the new system or process. Validation and ownership must be put in place where the business owners sign off on the data when taking it over. A stakeholder must take on responsibility of the data. Because of this, communication is a key element of a successful data migration project.

### The Challenge

Extract Skype's general ledger held on eBay's ERP system. The data had to be complete, balanced and validated by stakeholders in both Skype and eBay for accuracy and completeness. The number of transactions far exceeded Excel's capacity of 65,000 rows at the time so Excel had to process text files that held the data.

### The Solution

Create macros on Excel to process comma separated (csv) files. The macros had to summarize these files in order to validation tests in place and for final signoff. This was then joined into a larger process of overall validation of the data which had to be handed over to the business owners.

### The result

A well documented end to end process that showed the steps involved including business ownership and validation of data, provided confidence that all the relevant data had been extracted.

## Data Migration at Baxi

A well organised data migration project is similar to a data analysis project where it is documented well enough to be easily transferable and adaptable. If someone was picking it up in the future, they should be able to do so spending a minimum amount of time learning about the project and how it is structured. At Intellisolve, proper documentation is important. Each stage in the project is done with the necessary documentation as priority.

### The Challenge

Migrate all historical data from SAP R3 to a new M3 ERP system for 4 main SAP modules. The complete data set had to be put into a format that could be easily uploaded to M3 ERP system in a standard format. For each module, data for closed and open items and header and detailed information had to be extracted and put into a standard format for upload.

### The Solution

The project structure included raw data to the final dataset in the format required to upload into M3. Each of the transformations to the data was properly documented so the customer could tell the story of how the final dataset was derived. There were multiple sets of data which included the complete data set created in a format that could be queried for historical reasons as well as well as the formatted data set for upload.  
All the queries were documented showing the data sets as well as the meaning of each field.

### The Result

The complete processed and analysed data was presented on time and on budget with the required data sets to upload into the target system as well as the ability to query historical data without the need to revert to the source system. This meant a significant cost saving on maintenance.

## Business Case Analysis at Vodafone

Before creating a business case, it is best to start out with the business objectives and what the plan is to measure these. Once the objectives are worked out, the business case can then be built around these. Intellisolve have a standard methodology of delivering business centric business cases, working out the customer objectives first so stakeholders will be focused on this throughout the process.

### The Challenge

Vodafone was going through a major global infrastructure investment project. This involved multiple countries with multiple channels of investment which meant there was over a thousand business cases that needed to be appraised and the project required the ability to summarize these over different dimensions such as region, channel, country, etc.

### The Solution

The solution was to standardize all the business cases and create a reporting cube that could be easily sliced and diced and shared over the programme.

### The Result

Creating a single version of the truth meant there was consistency over the whole programme. Communication over the programme related to one data source where the data was validated and everyone agreed with. Intellisolve has a standard methodology for creating these golden sources of data which provides a well agreed upon data set in the shortest possible time.

## Computer Storage Allocation at HSBC

Bringing together different silos of data in your organisation is frequently a great source of insight. It gives you the ability to see how processes fit into the bigger picture of your organisation and how these function together. The data could already be available to you or be created with minimal effort to provide a greater benefit.

### The Challenge

HSBC wanted a view of how their data storage was utilized over the world. The source of the data came from a list of all their storage hardware and storage array logs. The view had to capture the country and regional summaries but also be able to drill down to an individual storage array level. All reporting had to be packaged in a way to allow storage executives to make strategic decisions on global storage.

### The Solution

Storage array logs generate a lot of data. When considered at a global level, it would normally break Excels one million line limit. As there was MS Office already installed on the development computer, the best fit solution was using MS Excel and MS Access.

#### Loading Data

The array operational logs would be saved to a location on the network and a VBA script would be run to import the data into an Access database. The old data would be summarized and archived for reporting and trend analysis. The new data would then be aggregated to make reporting queries more efficient and take less time to load.

#### Reporting

A host of reports were presented as dashboards on Excel. These reports connected to the summary tables on the access database and were refreshed when the reporting file was opened.

### The Result

The streamlined solution enabled all the dashboards to be generated just by opening and refreshing a file. The global views as well as the ability to drill down to region, country, data center and individual array let management see patterns in how data was allocated. Due to the overall investment of the bank, any insight into this area proved to be a massive benefit as optimisation provided significant cost saving.

## Automate Data Set Creation at the NHS

Automating processes is an opportunity of making your organisation more efficient. Automation can save time and improve accuracy and allows you to take on more than you normally would have during a manual process. We have the technical expertise and experience automating data processes and reporting using popular frameworks such as Excel VBA and the Python programming language.

### The Challenge

Automate a manual process which consolidated data from 3 different patient information systems. The final data set was according to national data set standards. The process would be automated from the extracting the data to creating the final data set.

### The Solution

An automated process was set in place using the Excel macros. Reporting within the process for summary information as well as trend analysis for local reporting.

#### Extraction

Data connections were created on Excel workbooks to run queries on the patient data systems. The queries were executed by running a VBA macro on the workbook.

#### Processing

The extracted data was copied onto a worksheet and this was then consolidated. If there were no proper formulas available, then macro formulas were used.

### The Result

-   The resulting solution shortened the process of creating the data set from 1 week to half a day. The only delay being the time taken to update the patient systems with the latest data.
-   Automation considerably improved the quality of the final dataset as it was less prone to human error.
-   Reporting systems in place meant that management could see an overview of each dataset with checks in place to ensure data quality.
