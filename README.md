# Services

With a great variety of business knowledge and experience. We are able to quickly understand your requirement and deliver the best solution using the right tools available to you. We specialise in finance processes but a lot of what we build can be applied to other areas of your business as well. 

## Automate Processes
Is an opportunity to make your processes more efficient. Automation can save time and improve the quality of tasks. As you can use computer code to carry out repetitive and time sensitive tasks while you focus on the higher level aspects of your business. 

### VBA Automation
Excel is in the finance department of most organisations. A VBA macro is computer code that you write in Excel that gives it instructions to do certain tasks. This could be as simple as opening, reading and closing a file to things more complex like reading hundreds of stock prices from the internet and updating prediction models. 
All the individual tasks can be grouped together and if done right, you have a very fast and accurate process that you can trigger either by clicking a button or that will run at some point in time without you even knowing it. 

Another cool thing about this is, using VBA, you can get MS Office applications to talk to each other and build solutions on top of the entire MS Office suite of programs. Hold you data in MS Access, do analysis and reporting on that data in MS Excel and present your findings in MS PowerPoint seamlessly. It's amazing how far you can go with this. 

VBA also allows you to write your own Excel functions. There are 500+ functions in Excel. If these are not enough, you can write your own. 

## Python Automation
Python is a general purpose programming language that has many applications from processing data to making your own games. This is where things get interesting. Python automation goes beyond spreadsheets. Python is like the glue that brings together different solutions and lets them talk to each other. 
Here are some of the things we have done with Python. 
Pattern matching with language processing tools. Read a large body of text very quickly and extract out the information you need. You can even figure out the mood of the sentence and if it is positive or negative. 
Read and write files or summarise data that is all over the place in different file formats in different directories.
Automatically visit as many web pages as you want and parse them for information. 
Schedule tasks that can be performed when you want them and be notified even on your phone when something happens. 

## Build Models
Statistical Modelling. Provides a basis for proving beyond reasonable doubt that there are patterns in your data. 

Financial Modelling. Financial modelling is the task of building an abstract representation (a model) of a real world financial situation. This is a mathematical model designed to represent (a simplified version of) the performance of a financial asset or portfolio of a business, project, or any other investment. If your model is complex and has many variables, you can test all possible combinations and sensitivities of variables. 

Business Case Development.


Data Modelling. When modelling complex processes, it helps to have an abstract simplified view of the data. It gives you a better understanding of the components in the process and allow you to make more informed decisions based on a better understanding of the data. A good data model is structured around its usefulness to the business and how it contributes to achieving business objectives.

## Analyse Data
Find patterns in your data as a single activity or build custom dashboards to keep on top of the business metrics that matter to your circumstances. Although Excel has all the functionality to build fairly complex models, Python has world class statistical and machine learning libraries and patterns to solve almost any analysis problem you can throw at it. 

As we as we have a focus on finance we have built many analysis solutions within the finance function and can use this experience to help you. 

## Data Migration
Data migration is moving data between applications. It means taking the data in the format that you currently have in your source system and changing it into a format that is useful in 
Data migration is taking the data in the format that you currently have and changing it 

Data migration done the right way will bear fruit in the future. We have a methodology that we follow. 
A well managed data migration will ensure only the required information will be moved across to the new system or process. Validation and ownership must be put in place where the business owners sign off on the data when taking it over. A stakeholder must take on responsibility of the data. Because of this, communication is a key element of a successful data migration project.



## Advisory
Getting data analysts involved in complex programs early in the process pays off in the future. As solutions become increasingly complex the cost of fixing problems later increases exponentially. Advice from an experienced data analyst who can understand your requirements can suggest organising data and process requirements around the program requirements giving you a higher likelihood of success. Intellisolve has acted in the capacity of adviser in large scale programs organizing and structuring data and processes early so program management has access to information when they need it.

# Tools we use
We specialise. Have used the same tools for many years and would like to think that that makes us think that we can give you the best advise and service among the best in the world. 

## Microsoft Excel
Properly implemented, MS Excel is a tool kit for your business. It gives you a basis to look deeper into your business, build models and help you to focus and shine a light on the numbers in your business that really matter.

## VBA
VBA is a programming language within the MS Office suite of applications that allows you to extend their functionality. The scripts or macros allow you to build custom solutions to your business requirements.

## MS Access
Probably the most underused application in the MS Office suite. Gives you the ability to bring together or maintain large amounts of data that can be consolidated and reported upon.

## Python
A general purpose programming language that could be used to solve business problems. Python has a widely used set of libraries that can be used to do things like data processing, statistics, data visualisation and even building web applications.

## Project Delivery
Although this is not a product it is a methodology.
