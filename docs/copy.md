# What we do

## Data Insight

Data insight is the process of extracting useful information from data. Useful in a business setting is information that will help your organisation achieve their goals. The objectives of insight projects should align with the business objectives. Although an insight project is a one off process, the outcomes will eventually be taken over by the business as it adapts to the new information.

Well organised data insight projects follow a methodology that builds its self around business objectives. The main stages in the project documented here.

Intellisolve has a tried and tested methodology used to deliver tangible results and deals with:

Helping frame the objectives of the of the project.
Enlisting subject matter experts on specialist knowledge within industries.
Creating models.
Interpreting and communicating results.
Building reporting pipelines to track future activity.
Overall project management.
We would like to hear from you. So get in touch for an initial consultation. We try to add value starting from the consultation working with you to gauge your requirements and the alternatives available to you.

## Management Reports
Financial and Management Reporting give you feedback on how well your business is achieving its objectives.

Financial Reporting
Financial reporting is a standard set of reports that all businesses need to produce to communicate with external stakeholders. It is a legal requirement that they are created in a particular format.

They consist of the Profit and Loss Account, Balance Sheet and Statement of Cashflows. They are externally focused and present a standard way of determining the health of the company. Financial Reporting is historically focused. Because they are in a standard format, they allow you to compare businesses and are the main documents used to convey the wellbeing of the business.

Management Reporting
Management Reporting is mainly used for the stakeholders running the business. They are a bespoke internally focused set of reports carefully considered to track to the objectives of the company.

Examples of management reporting are costing production of goods or getting a breakdown of staff by department.

Management reporting falls within a larger data analytics project and is involved in suggesting and gathering the most important metrics that an organisation needs to focus on in order to reach its business goals.

Intellisolve has worked on world class Management Accounting projects in a wide range of business settings, utilising the latest research on what is currently hot and working in the industry.

## Custom Dashboards
A dashboard is a tool that helps organisations track how they are performing against a given objective. It provides information about Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and metrics. Dashboards often make use of data visualizations as a means of making sense of complex data sets. They help to summarize a situation and helps users quickly draw conclusions on what the data is trying to tell them.

There are 2 popular approaches to creating dashboards. Each delivering a similar outcome to the same problem domain of delivering information from data.

Excel Dashboards
Due to Excels inherent flexibility, it has become one of the most widely used tools for creating dashboards for decades now. Although Excel has come a long way since the days of Lotus 123, its fundamental design philosophy has not changed. Excel's popularity means that users like what it does, providing a high quality platform for data storage, analysis and reporting.

Web Dashboards
Web dashboards take you beyond a file based reporting and address the shortcomings of reporting to multiple users. In addition to this, the solutions are elegant and robust and the quality of output is improved. There is a blog post on how to get up and running with a web dashboard and touches on some of the some of the reasons why you would adopt this approach to reporting.

Intellisolve has worked on a wide range of dashboarding projects, utilizing the latest technology and research on the best way to deliver information.

Dashboarding falls within a larger data analytics project and is involved in delivering information to the business in a way that is both timely and useful.

## Data Modelling
We can help you gain a better understanding of your processes and systems by organizing and summarizing the data available in your organisation. Viewing your data differently can give you a different perspective and thereby more insight into your business.
A well thought out data model gives you a understanding of your business and processes and helps you plan.

The main ways data can be modelled are:

Creating conceptual models of data to identify relationships at the highest level.
Modelling relationships between data sets in an enterprise.
Logical data modelling which models entities and the relationships between them.
Physical data models which are based on the logical data models.

## Financial Modelling

Financial modeling is the task of building an abstract representation (a model) of a real world financial situation. This is a mathematical model designed to represent (a simplified version of) the performance of a financial asset or portfolio of a business, project, or any other investment.

## Process Automation

Automating processes is an opportunity of making your organisation more efficient. Automation can save time and improve accuracy and allows you to take on more than you normally would have during a manual process. We have the technical expertise and experience automating data processes and reporting using popular frameworks such as Excel VBA and the Python programming language.

## Advisory

Getting data analysts involved in complex programs early in the process pays off in the future. As solutions become increasingly complex the cost of fixing problems later increases exponentially. Advice from an experienced data analyst who can understand your requirements can suggest organising data and process requirements around the program requirements giving you a higher likelihood of success. Intellisolve has acted in the capacity of adviser in large scale programs organizing and structuring data and processes early so program management has access to information when they need it.

## Data Migration

A well managed data migration will ensure only the required information will be moved across to the new system or process. Validation and ownership must be put in place where the business owners sign off on the data when taking it over. A stakeholder must take on responsibility of the data. Because of this, communication is a key element of a successful data migration project.

# Our Process
No two projects are alike but no two projects are entirely different. If you want to know what to expect when you engage with us have a look. It is designed to minimize any risk to you when getting your solution built.


You will own the solution in the end and a good solution is a useful one. Because of this, colloboration is key. You know your business, you know your industry, you know the problem to be solved. We will provide the technical know how. Understanding requirements are key to this process and we will constantly confirm that our understanding is correct using an agile way of building solutions. Our priority is to deliver excellence and to keep you coming back.


## Initial Enquiry
One of the most crucial parts of the process and the foundation for a successful project. We spend time getting a real understanding of your business need and how we can provide you the best solution.

## First Quotation

Based on the initial inquiry the quotation will outline the process of delivering the solution to you. It will include a rough estimation of the timeframe involved.


## Functional Specification

If you are happy with the initial quotation, we will create a detailed specification of what will be delivered. It could involve a visit to your organisation or meetings with the people benefitting from the solution. The functional specification will go in to as much detail as possible into not only what will be done but also what will not be done. It will ensure that all parties are on the same page about what is expected.

## Final Quotation
Once we have an exact understanding of what you need, the final quotation will be submitted. The final quotation will include details of time and cost. If we are working with any of your staff then the we will propose times for meetings. We will try and be as accommodating to your timings as possible.

## Project Development

The project will commence on the terms of the final quotation. We will try to stick to the timetable. Any changes will be discussed and approved. You will always be kept up to date on what is happening with the project.


## Testing
The quickest ways to iron out bugs in a solution is to have a comprehensive testing strategy that tests all elements of the solution both at a functional level but also the inner workings as well. All the items in the functional specification above will be tested and a complete test report will be presented to make sure you are aware of what was tested.


## Final Delivery
After everyone is happy with the tests, the project will go live. You will be using what was built in your business. In addition to the project, Intellisolve will provide useful documents like user manuals and documentation about the solutions so it could be taken over at a future date if needed.


# Our Services
We have experience in extracting and analysing data and publishing the results. These are a broad range of data services and can be specifically broken down into the following.


## Statistical Modelling
A statistical model takes the guesswork out of thinking there are patterns in your data. Using a statistical model, you can mathematically prove if there are relationships between elements of a dataset and if so you can assign a number to the degree of the relationship. When you model real world data, relationships are a grey area. There are exceptions to rules due to the complexity of real world interactions. Intellisolve sets up statistical models the same way as financial models, focusing on the business need first and building the model around that.

## Data Modelling
When modelling complex processes, it helps to have an abstract simplified view of the data. It gives you a better understanding of the components in the process and allow you to make more informed decisions based on a better understanding of the data. A good data model is structured around its usefulness to the business and how it contributes to achieving business objectives.

## Custom Dashboards
A dashboard is a tool that helps organisations track how they are performing against a given objective. It provides information about Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and metrics. Dashboards often make use of data visualizations as a means of making sense of complex data sets. They help to summarize a situation and helps users quickly draw conclusions on what the data is trying to tell them.

## Financial Data Analysis
Financial Data Analysis is the process of carrying out data analysis on financial data. A financial data analysis project has the same features of a data analysis project in that each of the stages are carried out to achieve a specific goal.

## Business Case Development
Before creating a business case, it is best to start out with the business objectives and what the plan is to measure these. Once the objectives are worked out, the business case can then be built around these. Intellisolve have a standard methodology of delivering business centric business cases, working out the customer objectives first so stakeholders will be focused on this throughout the process.

## Golden Sources
A single version of the truth is a business intelligence term which means reducing ambiguity about an organisations data by storing it in one place. A common problem in organisations is that silos of the same data start to emerge in different areas of the organisation which invariably start to contradict each other. Making sure all users of the same data draw from the same source is essential for users to have confidence in the data and minimize errors in reporting. Intellisolve has a standard methodology in creating these Golden Sources on data.

# Applications

## Microsoft Power BI
Connect to multiple sources and give users the ability to create their own dashboards.
Go beyond Excel's single user limitations and distribute a single version of the truth to all users.

## Microsoft Access
Probably the most underused application in the MS Office suite. Gives you the ability to bring together or maintain large amounts of data that can be consolidated and reported upon.

## Microsoft Excel
Properly implemented, MS Excel is a tool kit for your business. It gives you a basis to look deeper into your business, build models and help you to focus and shine a light on the numbers in your business that really matter.

## VBA
VBA is a programming language within the MS Office suite of applications that allows you to extend their functionality. The scripts or macros allow you to build custom solutions to your business requirements.

## Python
A general purpose programming language that could be used to solve business problems. Python has a widely used set of libraries that can be used to do things like data processing, statistics, data visualization and even building web applications.

## Python Pandas
Pandas is a library within the Python language that deals with data processing. It provides you with a two dimensional data frame, much like what is in MS Excel and gives you the functionality to code with this.

### The Challenge
An enterprise technology transformation project that needed a software to be installed on thousands of computers on a global network. The schedule of implementation had to be sequenced in a way to ensure minimum disruption to the network. In certain cases, other software had to be installed before the final implementation took place. As the project spanned over a year, proper planning needed to be done with a way of measuring and reporting actual performance against the plan.

### The Solution
A dynamic adaptable scheduling spreadsheet containing details of all the required computers in the network, with a plan for each computer to have the necessary software in place before the final implementation. The plan also included a reporting element for analysis and reporting to update actual performance against plan for management reporting. The spreadsheet contained a separate section that held all the variables which could be changed to see how this would affect the plan.

### The Result
A well organised project from the beginning meant management knew exactly where the project was at any time and how it was tracking to plan. The proper visibility of schedules meant that there was better organisation of resources from the beginning till the end. This resulted in a significant cost saving due to the proper allocation of resources and getting in getting consultants in only when they were needed.

## Custom Dashboards at PB
Custom Dashboards bring together the unique list of Key Performance Indicators (KPI's) that matter to your situation that needs to be measured. The key challenges are determining what needs to be measured and then how to go about getting the data at the right time to make it useful. Intellisolve has qualified Management Accountants to help you determine the right things to measure and experienced Data Analysts to work out the best way to get the data.

### The Challenge
Get an extract of all month end financial transactions from SAP and structure and report all transactions in a new organisation hierarchy. The hierarchy was regularly updated so users needed the ability to update the solution with the changes to the hierarchy. The reports had to be implemented across subsidiary companies in Europe and accommodate local reporting requirements.

### The Solution
An MS Access and Excel data solution where data extracted from SAP was loaded into MS Access, processed and finally reported on MS Excel. The solution also allowed for the organisation hierarchy to be loaded after an update happened. The reports were created in Excel which used the MS Access database as a source for data. This meant new reports could be created with minimum modification of the application as all the data was already available.

### The Result
The month end reporting timeline in finance was made shorter due to the early visibility of data. The customised reporting along with the ability to drill down to a transaction level meant that financial reconciliations were made easy. The finance teams could react to questions posed to them a lot quicker leading to less friction during month end reporting.


## Financial Data Analysis at HSBC

A well organized financial model shines a spotlight on the elements of the enterprise that guarantee success and the relationship between the components of the model. Users should be able to see how making a change in one of the components affects the others. At intellisolve, we have a standard methodology of creating models that focuses on business goals first. We then use our expertise in Excel to make these items stand out so that the finance can see what they need to focus on.

### The Challenge
Create a financial model that shows the state of global enterprise data storage. The model should give the ability to slice data by different dimensions such as line of business and type of hardware. The model should also summarize the current global view of storage and predict the future storage requirement based growth. The model should be able to run different scenarios to highlight what would happen in these alternate realities.

### The Solution
This was a two fold solution, first building a consolidated operational data model based on the HSBC global estate. The financial side  of the operational was presented separately. The model included a parameters section where all the variables were presented in one place along with the summary of the entire model. Here users could easily see the impact a change in one variable had in the rest of the model. This made it easy for users to consider alternative scenarios for enterprise storage in the short to long term.

### The Result
Using Intellisolve's business centric methodology for creating financial models meant the end product was created using a framework that was guaranteed to deliver a useful solution.
The final model clearly showed the relationships between the various components and gave executives overall visibility of the interactions between  components. The final product highlighted the areas where significant costs could be saved.

## Statistical Modelling Project
A statistical model takes the guesswork out of thinking there are patterns in your data. Using a statistical model, you can mathematically prove if there are relationships between elements of a dataset and if so you can assign a number to the degree of the relationship. When you model real world data, relationships are a grey area. There are exceptions to rules due to the complexity of real world interactions. Intellisolve sets up statistical models the same way as financial models, focusing on the business need first and building the model around that.

### The Challenge
Take a list of 10,000+ stock price movements and group them into similar transactions. Once the transactions were grouped, run simulations to infer the best trading strategies for specific categories of transactions. Once the best trading strategies were figured out, run optimization algorithms to infer the best parameters for the trading strategies to minimize risk while optimizing profit. All this to be put into a standard reporting format for further analysis.

### The Solution
A proper statistical and data analysis solution implemented within an agile framework to give the most relevant solution in the least possible time. Intellisolve has a standard methodology of delivering analysis solutions that has worked well in the past. The share price movements were held in a master data set. The solution was organized in such a way that the parameters could be changed in order to run simulations and scenario analysis and eventually work out the best trading strategies for specific categories of transactions.

### The Result
A complete end to end data analysis project from acquiring the data to processing to the final reporting in a way that was adaptable. Running strategies through parameters meant that when new strategies could be devised and evaluated quickly. Excellent web reporting meant that there was high quality reporting available for analysis with the option of going from a summary view to a drill down of data to a transaction level. Proper project organisation and documentation meant that this analysis could be taken over at a later date with minimum friction to the new users.

## Forms Reporting at the NHS
A forms application is a great solution for collecting data from multiple places and presenting reports to multiple users all from a web application. The application can be hosted either online or within your local network with great security in place making your data secure. Permissions on the application will ensure only the right people get access to the right information.

### The Challenge
Replace a paper based data collection system with an online web application. In the existing system, paper based records were faxed to a central location for review and updated and gathered onto a master Excel spreadsheet. Due to the nature of the operation this process was error prone and users spent a lot of time validating data. Resources were spent on security due to the sensitive nature of the information such as locked rooms and secure lines of communication.

### The Solution
The solution was a web application where the data was collected securely at source. It could then be validated at the point of entry guaranteeing only the highest quality data was captured. All past data was migrated into the application giving a historical view to users. All migrated data was tagged in the database to add security so it could be presented only on a need to know basis. A standard set of reports were made available to all users including customized reports when they were required.

### The Result
A seamless process to gather, validate and report on data. Users we more confident with the data due to the validation processes put in place. The new online system meant that all resources used to maintain the paper based records were freed up. The turnaround time for creating new reports was much faster because of the proper organisation and centralisation of data. Proper data analysis meant that more insightful reporting could be carried out to the benefit of NHS local authorities.

## Golden Sources at Deutsche Bank

A single version of the truth is a business intelligence term which means reducing ambiguity about an organisations data by storing it in one place. A common problem in organisations is that silos of the same data start to emerge in different areas of the organisation which invariably start to contradict each other. Making sure all users of the same data draw from the same source is essential for users to have confidence in the data and minimize errors in reporting. Intellisolve has a standard methodology in creating these Golden Sources on data.

### The Challenge
Create a Golden Source of data for employees within a major technology transformation project within Deutsche Bank. The transformation project had multiple work streams which affected different areas of the organisation structure. The golden source of employee data had to identify where the employees were on the organisation structure and what work streams affected them. This would be used for work stream baseline calculations to gauge the employees that fell under the scope of the workstream. The dataset had to be version controlled to reflect the changes made in the programme.

### The Solution
Create one golden source of employee data that included all the necessary information required for the programme work streams. This was a group project that required input from all the managers of the work streams including the major functions within the organisation. Documentation was available on how all the information was derived and the sources of the data. Any conflicts of data had to be documented and presented to the right stakeholders.  

### The Result
The result was a data set that all stakeholders sanctioned and were confident with the data. This was in a format that could be easily shared and tagged with new information came up. Version controlling meant that any changes in the data set could be documented and shared. The employee dataset was an important feature in the overall program. Having a single version of the truth meant that program decisions could be taken with less overall friction.

## Data Migration in Skype

A well managed data migration will ensure only the required information will be moved across to the new system or process. Validation and ownership must be put in place where the business owners sign off on the data when taking it over. A stakeholder must take on responsibility of the data. Because of this, communication is a key element of a successful data migration project.

### The Challenge
Extract Skype's general ledger held on eBay's ERP system. The data had to be complete, balanced and validated by stakeholders in both Skype and eBay for accuracy and completeness. The number of transactions far exceeded Excel's capacity of 65,000 rows at the time so Excel had to process text files that held the data.

### The Solution
Create macros on Excel to process comma separated (csv) files. The macros had to summarize these files in order to validation tests in place and for final signoff. This was then joined into a larger process of overall validation of the data which had to be handed over to the business owners.

### The result
A well documented end to end process that showed the steps involved including business ownership and validation of data, provided confidence that all the relevant data had been extracted.

## Data Migration at Baxi
A well organised data migration project is similar to a data analysis project where it is documented well enough to be easily transferable and adaptable. If someone was picking it up in the future, they should be able to do so spending a minimum amount of time learning about the project and how it is structured. At Intellisolve, proper documentation is important. Each stage in the project is done with the necessary documentation as priority.

### The Challenge
Migrate all historical data from SAP R3 to a new M3 ERP system for 4 main SAP modules. The complete data set had to be put into a format that could be easily uploaded to M3 ERP system in a standard format. For each module, data for closed and open items and header and detailed information had to be extracted and put into a standard format for upload.

### The Solution
The project structure included raw data to the final dataset in the format required to upload into M3. Each of the transformations to the data was properly documented so the customer could tell the story of how the final dataset was derived. There were multiple sets of data which included the complete data set created in a format that could be queried for historical reasons as well as well as the formatted data set for upload.  
All the queries were documented showing the data sets as well as the meaning of each field.

### The Result
The complete processed and analysed data was presented on time and on budget with the required data sets to upload into the target system as well as the ability to query historical data without the need to revert to the source system. This meant a significant cost saving on maintenance.

## Business Case Analysis at Vodafone
Before creating a business case, it is best to start out with the business objectives and what the plan is to measure these. Once the objectives are worked out, the business case can then be built around these. Intellisolve have a standard methodology of delivering business centric business cases, working out the customer objectives first so stakeholders will be focused on this throughout the process.

### The Challenge
Vodafone was going through a major global infrastructure investment project. This involved multiple countries with multiple channels of investment which meant there was over a thousand business cases that needed to be appraised and the project required the ability to summarize these over different dimensions such as region, channel, country, etc.

### The Solution
The solution was to standardize all the business cases and create a reporting cube that could be easily sliced and diced and shared over the programme.

### The Result
Creating a single version of the truth meant there was consistency over the whole programme. Communication over the programme related to one data source where the data was validated and everyone agreed with. Intellisolve has a standard methodology for creating these golden sources of data which provides a well agreed upon data set in the shortest possible time.

## Computer Storage Allocation at HSBC
Bringing together different silos of data in your organisation is frequently a great source of insight. It gives you the ability to see how processes fit into the bigger picture of your organisation and how these function together. The data could already be available to you or be created with minimal effort to provide a greater benefit.

### The Challenge
HSBC wanted a view of how their data storage was utilized over the world. The source of the data came from a list of all their storage hardware and storage array logs. The view had to capture the country and regional summaries but also be able to drill down to an individual storage array level. All reporting had to be packaged in a way to allow storage executives to make strategic decisions on global storage.

### The Solution
Storage array logs generate a lot of data. When considered at a global level, it would normally break Excels one million line limit. As there was MS Office already installed on the development computer, the best fit solution was using MS Excel and MS Access.

#### Loading Data
The array operational logs would be saved to a location on the network and a VBA script would be run to import the data into an Access database. The old data would be summarized and archived for reporting and trend analysis. The new data would then be aggregated to make reporting queries more efficient and take less time to load.
#### Reporting
A host of reports were presented as dashboards on Excel. These reports connected to the summary tables on the access database and were refreshed when the reporting file was opened.

### The Result
The streamlined solution enabled all the dashboards to be generated just by opening and refreshing a file. The global views as well as the ability to drill down to region, country, data center and individual array let management see patterns in how data was allocated. Due to the overall investment of the bank, any insight into this area proved to be a massive benefit as optimisation provided significant cost saving.

## Automate Data Set Creation at the NHS
Automating processes is an opportunity of making your organisation more efficient. Automation can save time and improve accuracy and allows you to take on more than you normally would have during a manual process. We have the technical expertise and experience automating data processes and reporting using popular frameworks such as Excel VBA and the Python programming language.

### The Challenge
Automate a manual process which consolidated data from 3 different patient information systems. The final data set was according to national data set standards. The process would be automated from the extracting the data to creating the final data set.

### The Solution
An automated process was set in place using the Excel macros. Reporting within the process for summary information as well as trend analysis for local reporting.

#### Extraction
Data connections were created on Excel workbooks to run queries on the patient data systems. The queries were executed by running a VBA macro on the workbook.

#### Processing
The extracted data was copied onto a worksheet and this was then consolidated. If there were no proper formulas available, then macro formulas were used.

### The Result
 - The resulting solution shortened the process of creating the data set from 1 week to half a day.  The only delay being the time taken to update the patient systems with the latest data.
 - Automation considerably improved the quality of the final dataset as it was less prone to human error.
 - Reporting systems in place meant that management could see an overview of each dataset with checks in place to ensure data quality.
